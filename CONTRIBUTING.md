Getting started

2. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   - git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cpitor
3. Create a feature branch:
   - git checkout -b feat/your-feature
4. Install dependencies and run locally (see README)
5. Make changes, run tests (if any), and ensure the app runs locally

Submitting changes
- Commit early with clear messages.
- Push your branch and open a Pull Request to the main branch.
- In your PR description, explain what you changed, why, and how to test it.

Good first contributions
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
- Documentation fixes, small bug fixes, and platform-specific tweaks (Windows/terminal) are great starting points.

Communication
- Open an issue first for larger features or breaking changes so we can discuss the design.
- Include reproduction steps, environment (OS, node/tauri versions), and logs where possible.

Thank you — your contributions make cpitor better for everyone!
